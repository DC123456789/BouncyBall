Here are some of my understanding of what we need to do:
In the beginning of the game, we:
  default x,y,color of ball, which is in the middle of VGA display and color white.
  default x,y,color of paddle, which is at the bottom middle of the VGA and white.

We need to make 3 FSMs.
  1 to draw the ball #see DrawBall.v
  2 to draw the paddle
  3 to determine the direction of the ball #the direction of paddle should be determined by the user input

We need to somehow connect all these together... Which I haven't thought through yet
